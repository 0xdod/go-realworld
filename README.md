# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Go standard net/http] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Go's net/http library]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Go]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here
The project structure was inspired by two posts on [Ben Johnson's](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson) blog which can be found [here](https://www.gobeyond.dev/packages-as-layers/) and [here](https://www.gobeyond.dev/standard-package-layout/).

# Getting started
#### Locally
> make sure Go is installed, (check here)[https://golang.org/dl] on how to install it if not.
